Filter
======

Filter is a process that removes some unwanted components from the data. To put some filter on the graph we have one dedicated panel for filter:

* Modal/Inline: We can view filter to the graph in two ways:

 Modal: By default Modal is selected, if modal is selected then filter is available by clicking on Filter button.

* Type: Type of the data could be Text, Date, Dynamic date, Number, look Up and Drop Down

  1. Text: By default the Type is text.

  2. Date: If we want to get data for some specific time period, then we can select type to Date

  3. Dynamic date: Dynamic date similar to date, the only difference is that it will automatically updated like for current month. A dynamic date is either a fixed set of dates or a range of dates that are a fixed offset of the current date.

  4. Number: If we select Number Type, then for filter we can only use number values.

  5. Look Up: If we will select Look Up Type then we can get your data on the basis of some condition i.e we can use query to get the data.

  6. Drop Down: If we will select Drop down Type then we can have values in drop down for filter.

* Default Value: you can put some default value for filter

  like we are selecting taking "E25" default value for plant

  .. image:: /images/filter05.png

  So, it will be visible when we will do filter, it will show data for "E25" default value

* Look Up Query: You can filter data based on some condition/query. Specify the table, query, or list of values that provides the values for the lookup field.

  like **select username,'' from users where lower(username) like '%<Q>%'**

* Invisible: invisible -> off that means filter would be visible.

* Mandatory: you can add some mandatory field for filter the data.

* Add: we can add another field for filter.

* Select Type: select type could be single or multiple.

* Search Type: Search type could be In, Not In, Like and Not Like.

* Show Type: It will show search type in the filter screen.
